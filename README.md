# The Developer Care Manifesto

This repository contains the text of the ["Developer Care Manifesto"](https://github.com/heetch/DeveloperCareManifesto/blob/master/Manifesto.md), as set out by the ["Developer Care"](https://link.medium.com/SzBR6jkD40) blog post on [https://eng.heetch.com](https://eng.heetch.com).

The main purpose of reproducing it here is to have a single, linkable point of reference for the manifesto itself.

## Introduction

The manifesto sets out a set of behaviours and characterstics for a
team of software engineers working in a "Developer Care" function.
Developer Care is a concept that came about in reaction to changes in
culture, and engineering practices in a company with a relatively
large number of engineers working on multiple customer facing software
products in a cloud based micro-services architecture.  For a thorough
understanding of the the teams origins and purpose please read the
blog post linked above.
