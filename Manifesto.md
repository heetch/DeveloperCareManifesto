# Developer Care Manifesto

## Know our mission

- Don’t look after cloud infrastructure. It requires a different set of skills and has a different relationship to product priorities.
- Don’t create or maintain “Business Logic”, keep a clear line of demarcation.
- Do create tools and libraries that shield product engineers from infrastructure concerns.
- Do talk to people. Listen to their pain points. Keep track of those pain points, even when they’re ephemeral.
- Do stay up to date, and don’t lose track of where the industry is going.
- Do anticipate tomorrow’s needs, and arrive with the right tools at hand.
- Do follow Open Source methodologies, even when we’re not doing open source. Publish as much code as possible. Assume that somebody else is going to read what you write.

## Act on the right time-scale

- Do respond to pressing needs. Sometimes a bandage is appropriate.
- Don’t over commit to “changing bandages”. Plan for surgery.
- Do look for the issues ahead of us, and try to create “tech credit” instead of just fighting “tech debt”.
- Don’t be bound by the release schedule of product teams.
- Don’t waste other teams time. Deliver when the product is ready. Remember, “less haste, more speed”.

## What kind of people are we?

- We are engineers who serve engineers. We don’t communicate via a non-technical manager.
- We are people who care about the code, and about the engineers who’ll use it.
- We are humble.
- We know the difference between complexity and complication. We embrace the first and reject the second.
- We practice safe coding. We release our code to others with extensive test coverage and detailed documentation.
- We are good listeners.
- We are excellent communicators. We explain what we’re doing, and why we’re doing it. We explain before we’re asked to explain.
